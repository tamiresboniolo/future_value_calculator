# Future Value Calculator

The purpose of this project is to utilize the things I learned so far with regard to JQuery selectors and events. On this project I 
add a script element to the HTML file that gives me access to the jQuery library. I try to change some of my JavaScript code so it uses as much jQuery as possible.
In addition I add a statement that moves the focus to the Investment Amount text box each time the Calculate button is clicked.
